# LUX-Longboard-Automation
 Atmel ATtiny85
 
 ---
 #### Description
 LLA (LUX Longboard Automation) is a program that connects a Atmel ATtiny85 microcontroller to the internal circuitry of the LUX electric longboard along with RGB LED strips along the underside of the board. The connection allows the microcontroller to read the voltage going to the motors. Motor voltage (~speed) allows the ATtiny to adjust the RGB strips dynamically based off the motors speed, or in this case, the change of speed over time. Basically the lights tell everyone how hard you're shredding!
